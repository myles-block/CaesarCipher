Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Program!

**Two Ways to Use Program
1: Run via terminal
2: Run via input file

---Run via Terminal
  1.)Execute command "$ python3 main.py <key>" in terminal
      ~if you do not add a key to the end the program will not run
  2.)Insert encoded phrase
  3.)Press q to stop and to return your encoded phrase as an encryption
  4.)Done!

---Run via Input File
  1.)Add encoded phrase into plaintext.txt file
  2.)Execute command "$ python3 main.py [<key>] < plaintext.txt > cryptedtex.txt" in terminal
  3.)Check cryptedtext.txt file for encoded phrase as an encryption
  4.)Done!
